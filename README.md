# Session 7 Assignment: Pandas II

In this Assignment, we handle missing data with Pandas as well as Data Transformation with Pandas

We use 2 synthetic datasets as a base which will also be modified later to test for edge cases:
### 1) Professor details (df)
### 2) Courses (df_courses)

There are also a total of 4 exercises:
1. Create a new column called **professor_initials** that stores the initials of each professor's first and last names.
2. Given the dataframe below. Use **join** to combine this new DataFrame with the original one based on the professor column.
3. Combine the original df and df_courses DataFrames (with merge).
4. In the professor column, create a new column professor_last_name by extracting the last name of each professor using string operations.
